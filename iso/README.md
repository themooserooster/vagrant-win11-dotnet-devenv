### What Is This Directory For?

You should place your installation images for Windows 11 and MS SQL Server 2019 in this folder named `windows_11.iso` and `sqlserver_2019.iso` respectively. 
If you want to use any other names, change `windows_iso_url` or `sqlserver_iso_url` in the `variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl` file.
